/*Josh Comeauâ€™s CSS reset (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
Historically, the main goal of a CSS reset has been to ensure consistency between browsers, and to undo all default styles, creating a blank slate. My CSS reset doesn't really do either of these things.
These days, browsers don't have massive discrepancies when it comes to layout or spacing. By and large, browsers implement the CSS specification faithfully, and things behave as you'd expect. So it isn't as necessary anymore.
This custom "CSS reset" include little tricks to improve both the user experience and the CSS authoring experience.
